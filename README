NAME
    Pod::WSDL::Writer - Writes XML output for Pod::WSDL

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

SYNOPSIS
      use Pod::WSDL::Writer;
      my $wr = new Pod::WSDL::Writer(pretty => 1, withDocumentation => 1);

DESCRIPTION
    This module is used internally by Pod::WSDL. By using AUTOLOADing it
    delegates all unknown methods to XML::Writer. It is unlikely that you
    have to interact directly with it. If that is the case, take a look at
    the code, it is rather simple.

METHODS
  new
    Instantiates a new Pod::WSDL::Writer. The method can take two parameters
    "pretty" with a true value triggers pretty printing of the WSDL output.
    "withDocumentation" with a true value produces a WSDL docuemnt
    containing documentation for types and methods.

  wrNewLine
    Has XML::Writer write a newline

  wrElem
    Has XML::Writer write an Element. The first argument is one of
    (empty|start|end), to write an empty element, a start or an end tag. The
    second argument signifies the name of the tag. All further arguments are
    attributes of the tag (does not work, when first argument is 'end')

  wrDoc
    Writes the string passed to the method as a <wsdl:documentation> Element

  registerWrittenFaultMessage
    There needs to be only one fault message per fault type. Here the client
    class can register fault types already written. The fault name is passed
    as the single argument to this method.

  faultMessageWritten
    Counterpart to registerWrittenFaultMessage. The client can ask if a
    fault message has already written. The fault name is passed as the
    single argument to this method.

  output
    Returns XML output.
